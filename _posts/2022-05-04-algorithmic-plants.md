Behold, a [plant generator](/plant-generator)!
<br /><br />
First, none of this would be possible without Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer’s Algorithmic Beauty of Plants [(pdf)](https://archive.org/details/the-algorithmic-beauty-of-plants/page/152/mode/2up). I was introduced to this book years ago and even made a [poster](/assets/AlgoPlants_Presentation.pdf) about it for a class assignment, but actually writing the code seemed too daunting at the time. Now I’ve done it! …sorta. 
<br /><br />
Even though it’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, I have ideas for future updates. I want to fully explore the \<canvas\> element and see if I can add some customizability (colors, layers, positions). I also want to add context-sensitive systems as well as introduce a growth function, plant density, etc. Everything shy of 3D and then I’ll teach myself enough openGL to make a standalone application.
<br /><br />
I’m finding myself interested in computer graphics right now and it would be nice to marry the two.
