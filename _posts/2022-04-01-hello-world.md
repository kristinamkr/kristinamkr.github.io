Welcome to my first post!
<br /><br /> 
Short post since there isn't a lot yet to share, but I've playing around with Lindenmeyer systems and I'm hoping to get that hooked up to the site soon. It's nothing crazy, but it'll be nice to have this place looking a little nicer. Further site functionality still pending... not sure what I want to do with any of this yet. 
<br /><br /> 
I'm going to try and post at least weekly and I have some projects I've been thinking about.
